# Airbnb Clone
This is a solo project I completed on Scrimba. The Airbnb-clone is a simple, responsive web page designed to showcase how to fetch and use data from an external data.js file in a React application. The project demonstrates how to separate data from the main application logic, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
